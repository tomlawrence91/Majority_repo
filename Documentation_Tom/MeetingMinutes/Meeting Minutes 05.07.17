05/07/17
Meeting
Participants: RDL, AP, TL

Overview: Choose your worms carefully!

General Notes & Actions: 

1) Give RDL access to repository on Github
2) Keep separate documentation and have access to everything in the code repository, not just in the wiki
3) Concentrate on 1/3 of the user stories
4) Create and structure the database based on the requirements of the user stories
5) Arrange a call with Dan every month
  a) Create a back up strategy for Dan - another customer or community/company outreach
6) Add in evaluation stages into the GANT chart
7) Target a niche and define it in the documentation
8) Make sure we have an electronic logbook
9) Make sure we have agendas for all the meetings
10) Make sure we provide minutes for all the meetings

Questions to think about: 
-	How will we present the budgets? 
- Will we need to implement or create some kind of change management system as well?
- What aspects of the budgets will users see on the application
- How will the application handle different budgets for separate projects? 
- What mechanisms already exist in the community and what behaviour could be made easier by our technology?
  - What are the type of issues raised? 
-	How will we implement this at a local level – does it require change management as well as technology? 


Meeting notes & Core takeaways
-	Look at the project in relation to the community and create a solution from the bottom up
-	Make the market smaller and narrow your focus to find the niche
-	Document all interactions with potential users and Dan
- Look at community processes and use them to define the technology
-	How does the local authority interact with potential users at the moment? 
-	We are providing tech for the user, focus on our target market (Dan) and don’t stray away from the stated offering 

Notes for working

-	Find a balance between the sum of the parts and our individual contributiions
- Create a plan, implementation -> integration -> finished product
- Look at technologies we need
- Leave the authentication for now and focus on the backend and planning of the application
- Look at new issues to integrate
- Clarify which platforms we will use and ensure we are both aligned
- Define how fat or slim the front end is
- Be very clear about the purpose of the project from the outset
- Reduce and provide constraints for everything 
- Find a regime

NB: 

RDL is away 1st week of August
