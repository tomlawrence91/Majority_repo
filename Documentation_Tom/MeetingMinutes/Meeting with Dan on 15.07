Outline of Minutes: 

*****LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW*****

NB: It can be tough identifying funds though. Often council members will already have an idea about how they want to spend
the pot. 

Different councils have different approaches
- Councils are predominantly tory-run but there are also labour-run councils. 
- Best approach for adoption is to lobby councils elected members
- Ignore MPs for now
- Target Elected councillors, they are the people to approach / lobby
  - They each have a budget that they assign to things
  
Local spending is divided three ways:
- Councils, trusts and people trying to do good

Directorates: 
Adult Social Care, Health, Housing, Environment & Communities, Leisure, Children's social care, Chief Executive Office, 
corporate.

These directorates are similar across the country but will be different in every council. 
- First go on council websites to find out 

Look at their services and ignore directorates. 
Look at Councillors (Members) to see what their roles are for targetting. 

*****BUDGET SIGN-OFF*****

A group of people will sign off big budgets
- They will have specific criteria built into the web form
- Senior person who would have commissioned the budget will sign it off
- Smaller group of people who look at individual projects
- As long as a pot of money is pre-authorised then they don't need further sign off higher up the chain 

*****LANDSCAPE RESEARCH*****

Tudor Trust 
Green Ham Common Trust
Both have large funding pots and the way this spending is decided could be done by voting

Disability Adjusted Life Years**
Quality Adjusted Life Years**

*****BUSINESS MODEL DISCUSSION*****

Create an application and web interface that we can license - and get them to sign it off once a year.
Make it customisable for each council - they will all be different
Provide tech support but ultimately let them run it and handle all budgets, validations and sign-offs. 

We may have difficulty with user verification. 
Could use unique numbers from the council - similar to that for parking etc.

Is majority at risk of this app exemplifying popularism

**APPROACH FOR DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS**

Council offices 
  - Non political, save money and time - remove the hassle
  - Speak to the coordinator of volunteering & funds
  - They don't like losing control, so for them it's all about assuaging those fears
Politicians
  - Engage people with politics, data feedback 
  - For them its about the win in the public eye
Public 
  - Power to the people etc

*****BUILD REQUIREMENTS*****

Create a template of some description in web form for the budgets. 
**ASK DAN - what would that form/paperwork look like or include in Bracknell**

Briefs need to be editable 
  - Users at this stage should get a notification when the scope of the brief is adjusted by a council
  
Make majority easy to edit by non-technical administrative staff
Make it easy to add extra questions etc
Ensure that we can white label it effectively. Includes logos, design and colouration. Ensure that it is easy to customise in
terms of branding. 

*****NOTES******

Dan is happy to be part of a case study for us. 
Dan is happy for us to set up regular calls with him 
He has suggested that when we have a clearer idea of how we will frame majority - to pitch it to him again and he will
help us from there
