Date: 23.06.17 - Friday
Summary: User case studies, use case scenarios, research into Android requirements, download of all relevant material and programs, comprehensive initial timeline and accountability plan
Location: Living room at Hannover Place
Details: Divided up the use case scenarios and then built the use case diagram together. I put our together a timeline plan and overview of what we had to complete on Google Sheets. 
Andy set us up on Google Drive and put together the worded use case scenarios.

Date: 24.06.17 - Saturday
Summary: Started the class diagrams, researched early Android requirements and downloads. Defined UI requirements and began to build them on Android Studio. We also linked our GitHub repositories up to Android Studio and tested. 
Location: Living room at Hannover Place
Details: Following work on 23.06 we took the diagrams a step further and expanded on our use case diagrams, building a rough layout of what the application would look like in pseudo code. 
We also put some time into working out what we would need to begin in our Android Studio framework and how that might look in our class diagram - and whether we needed a data flow diagram for it. 
-I’m slightly worried that we’re building a little too much for the user environment at the moment and not linking what we have on the front end design to the back end, but we will have to focus on the back end integrations a little more in the coming weeks... we’re really only into our second day of actually coding, so things could be worse! 
- We made some pretty decent progress though. Tomorrow we need to focus on making our class diagrams concrete and drawing a visual map so that we are both clear on what we need to complete. 
- It would also be good to put some more time into research, to find out what already exists code-wise and see if anyone has done anything a different / better way to our current approach. 
- Pleased to have GitHub and Android Studio working in harmony so early on.
